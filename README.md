# Patterns
A Nintendo Switch Theme.

![](https://github.com/zzzribas/Patterns/blob/main/Vertical/github.gif)

Hello again,

I am back in the scene and I have just created a new theme. Im really pround of this one.
I have learned a lot about animations and put in a lot of trial and error to create this.

I have made numerous edits to the esthetics, and added a lot of animations. I achieved this by using a pattern image that can be multiplied and by moving the pane up and down using a BLFAN.

Currently, this theme is only available for vertical icons. However, if there is demand, I can create a version for 1:1 icons as well.

I would like to give a big BIG thanks to my friend Capybara (u/darkerthansvart) for all his help and for sharing his notes on animations and panes with me. His themes have inspired me to purchase another Switch just to experience his work and get back into theming.

You can download the theme on Themezer:
Vertical - https://themezer.net/packs/Patterns.-58f
Standard - 

I will also be creating documentation on how to create your own moving themes on Github soon.

-UPDATE-
Now also for 1x1 Standard Nintendo Icons.

# BUGS:

There are currently a few known bugs that I am aware of, and I would appreciate it if you could share any bugs you come across so I can fix them.

The main menu animation is not fully animated and will stop after 64000 frames (around 8 minutes) unless you enter the settings, all apps, my page, or lock/unlock the Switch. Although there may be a way to loop it, the entrance sound will play every time it loops, which is annoying.

The background animation is only applied to the main menu. I tried very hard to find a way to apply it elsewhere, but it may be due to my lack of knowledge.

If you press the '+' button on a game in the main menu, the animation will stop because it calls an unknown szs (I couldn't find it, at least).

I hope you enjoy my new theme, Patterns!"
